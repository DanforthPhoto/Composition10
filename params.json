Depth allows a picture to be more real by conveying 3-dimensionality. \r\n\r\n##Framing\r\n\r\nFraming refers to the use of natural or man made frames (windows, gaps in branches) to isolate the subject inside an area. \r\n\r\n##Cropping\r\n\r\nChoosing the area for a shot and “cropping” the shot can let a subject that would otherwise not stand out be more apparent.\r\n\r\n##Experimentation\r\n\r\nExperimentation is exactly what it sounds like - trying out new concepts or inventing your own shot, and sometimes ending up with a completely unique picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n[**Back to the main page**](http://danforthphoto.github.io/Photography/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
