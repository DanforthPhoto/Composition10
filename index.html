        <p>This page is for my Top 10 composition constructs.</p>

<h2>
<a name="rule-of-thirds" class="anchor" href="#rule-of-thirds"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rule of Thirds</h2>

<p>The concept of rule of thirds involves setting up a shot so that key elements in the picture on on the vertical and horizontal lines that would be created if the shot were split into 9 parts.</p>

<h2>
<a name="backgroundnegative-space" class="anchor" href="#backgroundnegative-space"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background/Negative Space</h2>

<p>In photography, empty/repetitively patterned backgrounds often create a more favourable composition and draw the eye of the viewer to the subject.</p>

<h2>
<a name="balancing-elements" class="anchor" href="#balancing-elements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Balancing Elements</h2>

<p>Balancing elements refer to elements in the picture that keep a shot from being too weighted in any direction.</p>

<h2>
<a name="leading-lines" class="anchor" href="#leading-lines"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Leading Lines</h2>

<p>The idea of leading lines centers around shots that have strong lines (such as paths, rows of fences) that draw the eye and cause the viewer to follow them while observing the image.</p>

<h2>
<a name="symmetry-and-patterns" class="anchor" href="#symmetry-and-patterns"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Symmetry and Patterns</h2>

<p>Symmetry is not always important in a shot and many pictures benefit from non-symmetry, but a composition that has good symmetry is often more appealing and/or satisfying.</p>

<h2>
<a name="viewpoint" class="anchor" href="#viewpoint"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Viewpoint</h2>

<p>Changing the viewpoint of a shot or presenting an image from an unusual angle (from the top of a building/from underwater) creates a more interesting composition, even with boring subjects.</p>

<h2>
<a name="depth" class="anchor" href="#depth"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Depth</h2>

<p>Depth is a very important thing to be considering when taking a picture, be it a macro shot, a landscape, or a portrait. Depth allows a picture to be more real by conveying 3-dimensionality. </p>

<h2>
<a name="framing" class="anchor" href="#framing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Framing</h2>

<p>Framing refers to the use of natural or man made frames (windows, gaps in branches) to isolate the subject inside an area. </p>

<h2>
<a name="cropping" class="anchor" href="#cropping"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cropping</h2>

<p>Choosing the area for a shot and “cropping” the shot can let a subject that would otherwise not stand out be more apparent.</p>

<h2>
<a name="experimentation" class="anchor" href="#experimentation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experimentation</h2>

<p>Experimentation is exactly what it sounds like - trying out new concepts or inventing your own shot, and sometimes ending up with a completely unique picture.</p>
